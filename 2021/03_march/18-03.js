//You are given two sorted arrays that both only contain integers. Your task is to find a way to merge them into a single one, sorted in asc order. Complete the function mergeArrays(arr1, arr2), where arr1 and arr2 are the original sorted arrays.
//You don't need to worry about validation, since arr1 and arr2 must be arrays with 0 or more Integers. If both arr1 and arr2 are empty, then just return an empty array.
//Note: arr1 and arr2 may be sorted in different orders. Also arr1 and arr2 may have same integers. Remove duplicated in the returned result.
